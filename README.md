# GooglePhotosTakeoutOrganize
Utilitary to remove short videos of live photos and organize pictures by month

I used google photos for years, but now I want to keep a copy of all my photos in my computer. As google doesn't allow this, i moved to onedrive.
I created this program to solve two problems:
1 - Remove short videos of live photos (keep the image)
2 - Organize photos by month instead of year like google does

You need to use google takeout before use this program.
My case: 80GB of photos.

For developers:
Visual studio 2022
.net8


If you have a file outside folders structure, look in the properties of the file and put it in the right folder before run to get all things done :)

If you have different needs like bellow, please, send me a message.

1 - Move pictures wihtout date to a different folder
2 - Use year of picture date instead of folder's name
3 - Organize in other way
4 - Custom name of 'Photos of YEAR'
5 - Compile for another plataform (linux)
6 - Anything else
